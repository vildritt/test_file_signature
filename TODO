    + cli <in_file_path> <out_file_path> <buffer_size=1M>
    + buffer_size = 512b .. 10Mb
    + fill up last block with zeros
    + output: for each block hex md5 digest must be given. new line delimiter not specified - make tunable
    - hash = MD5
- [0] make threaded - parallel loop woth accumulator of results to stream?
- [0] check output file write ok before hashing
! [0] files sizes range: 0 - 128G. Check zero file have at least one block!
- [0] mem consumption <= 1G - eval max thread count
- [0] OS: Win, *nix - build on win also
- [0] file path support: block device, net device
- [0] MT correctness
- [0] diag. log - use exceptions?
- [0] optimize speed for MT environment
- [1] diff strategies for HDD, SSD, NETWORK?
- [1] usage from file
- [3] impl big-endian MD5 impl
